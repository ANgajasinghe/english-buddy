    <h1 class='text-3xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>What is Pronunciation?</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> 'Pronunciation' refers to the way in which we make the sound of words.</p>
    <br>
    <p> To pronounce words, we push air from our lungs up through our throat and vocal cords, through our mouth, past
      our tongue and out between our teeth and lips. (Sometimes air also travels through our nose.)</p>
    <br>
    <p> To change the sound that we are making, we mainly use the muscles of our mouth, tongue and lips to control the
      shape of our mouth and the flow of air. If we can control the shape of our mouth and the flow of air correctly,
      then our pronunciation is clearer and other people understand us more easily.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Speakers of different languages tend to develop different muscles of the mouth for pronunciation. When we speak
      a foreign language, our muscles may not be well-developed for that language, and we will find pronunciation more
      difficult. By practising the foreign language pronunciation, our muscles develop and pronunciation improves.</p>
    <br>
    <p> As well as creating correct vowel and consonant sounds using the muscles of our mouth, tongue and lips, there
      are other important aspects of pronunciation, including:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium '>
      <li>1. word stress - emphasis on certain syllables in a word</li>
      <li>2. sentence stress - emphasis on certain words in a sentence</li>
      <li>3. linking - joining certain words together</li>
      <li>4. intonation - the rise and fall of our voice as we speak</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>Difference Between Vowels and Consonants</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p class='text-6xl' style='text-shadow: 3px 3px #c8cdcf'> A B</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first two letters of the English alphabet are A and B.</p>
    <br>
    <p class='text-3xl'><strong>A</strong> is a vowel.</p>
    <br>
    <p class='text-3xl '><strong>B</strong> is a consonant.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So? Whatâ€™s the difference between vowel and consonant?</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>The difference is actually very simple:</p>
    <br>
    <p class='text-2xl font-medium'>To say <strong>A</strong> you open your mouth.</p>
    <p class='text-2xl font-medium'>To say <strong>B</strong> you open your mouth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In general, when you say a vowel you do not block the flow of air.
      But when you say a consonant, you block the flow of air, for example by</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium list-disc px-5'>
      <li>pressing your lips together (as for B)</li>
      <li>pressing your bottom lip against your teeth (as for F)</li>
      <li>pressing your tongue against the top of your mouth (as for L)</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>2) Brainstorm Your Topic</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> You cannot write an essay unless you have an idea of what to write about. Brainstorming is the process in which
      you come up with the essay topic. You need to simply sit and think of ideas during this phase.</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium '>
      <li>Write down everything that comes to mind as you can always narrow those topics down later.</li>
      <li>Use clustering or mind mapping to brainstorm and come up with an essay idea. This involves writing your topic
        or idea in the center of the paper and creating bubbles (clouds or clusters) of related ideas around it.
      </li>
      <li>Brainstorming can be a great way to develop a topic more deeply and to recognize connections between various
        facets of your topic.
      </li>
      <li> Once you have a list of possible topics, it's time to choose the best one that will answer the question posed
        for your essay. You want to choose a topic that is neither too broad nor too narrow.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>If you are given an assignment to write a one-page essay, it would be far too much to write about 'the history of
      the U.S.,' since that could fill entire volumes of books. Instead, you could write about a specific event within
      the history of the United States: perhaps signing the Declaration of Independence or when Columbus discovered the
      Americas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Choose the best topic idea from among your list and begin moving forward on writing your essay. But, before you
      move forward, take heed of these topics to avoid.</p>
