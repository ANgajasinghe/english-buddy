    <p class='font-medium text-xl'>Essays are common in middle school, high school and college. You may even need to
      write essays in the business world (although they are usually called reports at that point). An essay is defined
      as a short piece of writing that expresses information as well as the writer's opinion. Learn how to write an
      essay using 8 simple steps.</p>

    <br>
    <p> For some, writing an essay is as simple as sitting down at their computer and beginning to type. But a lot more
      planning goes into writing an essay successfully. If you have never written an essay before, or if you struggle
      with writing and want to improve your skills, it is a good idea to follow a number of important steps in the essay
      writing process.</p>
    <br>
    <p> For example, to write an essay, you should generally:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium '>
      <li>1. Decide what kind of essay to write</li>
      <li>2. Brainstorm your topic</li>
      <li>3. Research the topic</li>
      <li>4. Choose a writing style</li>
      <li>5. Develop a thesis</li>
      <li>6. Outline your essay</li>
      <li>7. Write your essay</li>
      <li>8. Edit your writing to check spelling and grammar</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>While this sounds like a lot of steps to write a simple essay, if you follow them you will be able to write more
      successful, clear and cohesive essays.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>1) Choose the Type of Essay</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> The first step to writing an essay is to define what type of essay you are writing. There are four main
      categories into which essays can be grouped:</p>
    <br>
    <ul class='font-medium list-disc px-5'>
      <li>Narrative essay - Tell a story or impart information about your subject in a straightforward, orderly manner,
        like in a story.
      </li>
      <li>Persuasive essay - Convince the reader about some point of view.</li>
      <li>Expository essay - Explain to the reader how to perform a given process. You could, for example, write an
        expository essay with step-by-step instructions on how to make a peanut butter sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>Descriptive essay - Focus on the details of what is going on. For example, if you want to write a descriptive
        essay about your trip to the park, you would give great detail about what you experienced: how the grass felt
        beneath your feet, what the park benches looked like, and anything else the reader would need to feel as if he
        were there.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Knowing what kind of essay you are trying to write can help you decide on a topic and structure your essay in the
      best way possible. Here are a few other types of essays:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium list-disc'>
      <li>Argumentative essay - Take a position on a controversial issue and present evidence in favor of your position.
        If youâ€™ve been assigned an argumentative essay, check out these top 10 argumentative essay topics.
      </li>
      <li>Compare and contrast essay - Identify similarities and differences between two subjects that are, typically,
        under the same umbrella.
      </li>
      <li>Problem solution essay - Describe a problem, convince the reader to care about the problem, propose a
        solution, and be prepared to dismantle objections.
      </li>
      <li>Informative essay - Educate the reader on a particular topic with facts.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>2) Brainstorm Your Topic</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> You cannot write an essay unless you have an idea of what to write about. Brainstorming is the process in which
      you come up with the essay topic. You need to simply sit and think of ideas during this phase.</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium '>
      <li>Write down everything that comes to mind as you can always narrow those topics down later.</li>
      <li>Use clustering or mind mapping to brainstorm and come up with an essay idea. This involves writing your topic
        or idea in the center of the paper and creating bubbles (clouds or clusters) of related ideas around it.
      </li>
      <li>Brainstorming can be a great way to develop a topic more deeply and to recognize connections between various
        facets of your topic.
      </li>
      <li> Once you have a list of possible topics, it's time to choose the best one that will answer the question posed
        for your essay. You want to choose a topic that is neither too broad nor too narrow.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>If you are given an assignment to write a one-page essay, it would be far too much to write about 'the history of
      the U.S.,' since that could fill entire volumes of books. Instead, you could write about a specific event within
      the history of the United States: perhaps signing the Declaration of Independence or when Columbus discovered the
      Americas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Choose the best topic idea from among your list and begin moving forward on writing your essay. But, before you
      move forward, take heed of these topics to avoid.</p>
