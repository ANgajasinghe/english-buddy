    <p class='font-medium text-xl'>Paraphrasing means formulating someone else’s ideas in your own words. To paraphrase
      a source, you have to rewrite a passage without changing the meaning of the original text.</p>
    <br>
    <p class='text-xl'>Paraphrasing is an alternative to quoting, where you copy someone’s exact words and put them in
      quotation marks. In academic writing, it’s usually better to paraphrase instead of quoting, because it shows that
      you have understood the source and makes your work more original.</p>
    <br>
    <p class='text-xl'>Every time you paraphrase, it’s important to cite the source. You also have to be careful not to
      use wording that is too similar to the original. Otherwise, you could be at risk of committing plagiarism.</p>

      <li>2. Note down key concepts</li>
      <li>3. Write your version of the text without looking at the original</li>
      <li>4. Compare your paraphrased text with the original passage and make minor adjustments to phrases that remain
        too similar

    <p> The five steps to paraphrasing may seem straightforward, but writing an idea in a different way than the
      published version can be difficult. These are four tricks you can apply to help you do so.</p>
    <br>
    <ul class='font-medium list-disc px-5'>
      <li>Start your first sentence at a different point from that of the original source</li>
      <li>Use synonyms (words that mean the same thing)</li>
      <li>Change the sentence structure (e.g. from active to passive voice)</li>
      <li>Break the information into separate sentences</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Knowing what kind of essay you are trying to write can help you decide on a topic and structure your essay in the
      best way possible. Here are a few other types of essays:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium list-disc'>
      <li>Argumentative essay - Take a position on a controversial issue and present evidence in favor of your position.
        If you’ve been assigned an argumentative essay, check out these top 10 argumentative essay topics.
      </li>
      <li>Compare and contrast essay - Identify similarities and differences between two subjects that are, typically,
        under the same umbrella.
      </li>
      <li>Problem solution essay - Describe a problem, convince the reader to care about the problem, propose a
        solution, and be prepared to dismantle objections.
      </li>
      <li>Informative essay - Educate the reader on a particular topic with facts.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>2) Brainstorm Your Topic</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> You cannot write an essay unless you have an idea of what to write about. Brainstorming is the process in which
      you come up with the essay topic. You need to simply sit and think of ideas during this phase.</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium '>
      <li>Write down everything that comes to mind as you can always narrow those topics down later.</li>
      <li>Use clustering or mind mapping to brainstorm and come up with an essay idea. This involves writing your topic
        or idea in the center of the paper and creating bubbles (clouds or clusters) of related ideas around it.
      </li>
      <li>Brainstorming can be a great way to develop a topic more deeply and to recognize connections between various
        facets of your topic.
      </li>
      <li> Once you have a list of possible topics, it's time to choose the best one that will answer the question posed
        for your essay. You want to choose a topic that is neither too broad nor too narrow.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>If you are given an assignment to write a one-page essay, it would be far too much to write about 'the history of
      the U.S.,' since that could fill entire volumes of books. Instead, you could write about a specific event within
      the history of the United States: perhaps signing the Declaration of Independence or when Columbus discovered the
      Americas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Choose the best topic idea from among your list and begin moving forward on writing your essay. But, before you
      move forward, take heed of these topics to avoid.</p>
