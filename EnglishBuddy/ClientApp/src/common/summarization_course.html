    <p class='font-medium text-xl'>Summarizing means giving a concise overview of a text’s main points in your own
      words. A summary is always much shorter than the original text.</p>
    <br>
    <p class='font-medium text-xl'> Writing a summary does not involve critiquing or analyzing the source—you should
      simply provide a clear, objective, accurate account of the most important information and ideas, without copying
      any text from the original and without missing any of the key points.</p>

    <h1 class='text-3xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>When to summarize</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> There are many situations in which you might have to summarize an article or other source:</p>
    <br>
    <ul class='font-medium list-disc px-5'>
      <li>As a stand-alone assignment to show you’ve understood the material.</li>
      <li>To keep notes that will help you remember what you’ve read.</li>
      <li>To give an overview of other researchers’ work in a literature review.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>When you’re writing an academic text like an essay, research paper, or dissertation, you’ll engage with other
      researchers’ work in a variety of ways. Sometimes you might use a brief quote to support your point; sometimes you
      might paraphrase a few sentences or paragraphs. </P>
    <br>
    <p> But it’s often appropriate to summarize a whole article or chapter if it is especially relevant to your own
      research, or to provide an overview of a source before you analyze or critique it.</P>
    <br>
    <p> In any case, the goal of summarizing is to give your reader a clear understanding of the original source. Follow
      the 4 steps outline below to write a good summary.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>1) Read the text</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> You should read the article more than once to make sure you’ve thoroughly understood it. It’s often effective to
      read in three stages:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium'>
      <li>1) Scan the article quickly to get a sense of its topic and overall shape.</li>
      <li>2) Read the article carefully, highlighting important points and taking notes as you read.</li>
      <li>3) Skim the article again to confirm you’ve understood the key points, and re-read any particularly important
        or difficult passages.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>There are some easy tricks you can use to identify the key points as you read:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class='font-medium list-disc px-5'>
      <li>Start by reading the abstract—this already contains the author’s own summary of their work, and it tells you
        what to expect from the article.
      </li>
      <li>Pay attention to headings and subheadings—these should give you a good sense of what each part is about.</li>
      <li>Read the introduction and the conclusion together and compare them: what did the author set out to do, and
        what was the outcome?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class='text-2xl font-semibold text-left text-blue-800'>2) Break the text down into sections</h1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> To make the text more manageable and understand its sub-points, break it down into smaller parts.</p>
    <br>
    <p> If the text is a scientific paper that follows a standard empirical structure, it is probably already organized
      into clearly marked sections, usually including an introduction, methods, results, and discussion.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Other types of articles may not be explicitly divided into sections. But most articles and essays will be
      structured around a series of sub-points or themes.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Try writing a word or phrase in the margin next to each paragraph that describes the paragraph’s content. Then
      you can see at a glance what each part of the article focuses on. If several paragraphs cover similar or related
      topics, you may group them together in sections.</p>
